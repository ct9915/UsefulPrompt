Create a web app for removing watermarks from images using a clone stamp tool similar to Photoshop. 
The app should allow users to upload an image, then use a brush tool to select a source area by alt-clicking and paint over the watermark by clicking and dragging to clone pixels from the source area. 
Include adjustable brush size using a slider, opacity control from 0 to 100 percent, and a hardness/softness setting for blending. 
Add an undo button to revert the last action and a download button to save the edited image. Use HTML5 canvas for the image editing functionality with JavaScript for the clone stamp logic. 
Make the interface clean with the image preview centered, control buttons on the left sidebar, and clear instructions showing users how to alt-click to set source point and regular click to clone. 
Ensure the cloned areas blend naturally with surrounding pixels and maintain alignment during brush strokes. 
Style it with a modern dark theme interface similar to professional photo editing software.
